# Statistical Data Analysis - Course Documentation

##  Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks (`ipynb` files) documenting the practical implementation of topics covered in the course **"Análisis estadístico de datos"** (Statistical Data Analysis), taught by Dr. Diego Ravignani at ITEDA-CNEA/CONICET (Instituto Sabato, UNSAM-CNEA). The course was part of the **Doctorate in Astrophysics** program and covered advanced statistical methods with applications in physics and data science.

## Topics Covered
The notebooks are organized according to the course syllabus:

### 1. **Discrete Probability**
   - Bernoulli and uniform distributions  
   - Mean, variance, standard deviation  
   - Bayes' theorem, binomial/Poisson distributions  
   - Convolution of random variables  

### 2. **Continuous Probability**
   - Gaussian, chi-square, and exponential distributions  
   - Central limit theorem  
   - Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (ideal gas)  
   - Histograms and radioactive decay modeling  

### 3. **Multidimensional Probability**
   - Joint/marginal/conditional probability  
   - Covariance and correlation  
   - Multidimensional Gaussian distributions  
   - Variance propagation  

### 4. **Parameter Estimation**
   - Maximum likelihood estimators (Gaussian, Poisson, binomial)  
   - Bias, consistency, efficiency  
   - Likelihood ratio tests  

### 5. **Confidence Intervals**
   - Classical confidence intervals  
   - Student’s *t*-interval (small samples)  
   - Likelihood regions  

### 6. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Significance tests (e.g., "tea taster experiment")  
   - COVID vaccine clinical trial example  
   - Chi-square tests and *p*-values  
   - Linear discriminant analysis (cosmic ray classification)  

### 7. **Data Fitting**
   - Linear/non-linear χ² fitting  
   - Maximum likelihood fitting  
   - Histogram fitting
